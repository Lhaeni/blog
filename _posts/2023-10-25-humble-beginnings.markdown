I welcome you to Lhaeni's Creative Mind.

My name is Lhaeni. I am a 25-year-old female, who is here to tell you about my Creative Mind, and why I chose the name "Lhaeni's Creative Mind".

It all started when I was 18, I was a normal teenager and college kid, but later in life, I felt different, due to the fact I started becoming jealous of all of my female family members, with the clothing they were wearing, and what not, I started wondering if I was different in myself, and well turns out I had no idea as to what the term "Transgender" was until I was accepted into an LGBT Community, held by my college teacher. I ended up experimenting with different clothing and whatnot, finally becoming myself and I ended up liking it, but the only thing stopping me was my family, as I ended up being brought as my birth gender which was formally a male, and by the name "Reece" but I am here to tell you why I was like this, and since I moved out at the age of 18, I've been so focused in what I'm wanting to pursue, being myself as a female, and well my old birth gender, and name is still normally used by everyone until I'm able to gather the funds to end up changing it legally, I still want to tell you why I am writing this blog, or the main reasons why I felt comfortable in sharing these experiences with a community whom I felt comfortable with. I used to be bullied by everyone by getting asked so many questions and everything, I ended up being judged by peers at work, and social parties that formed with family gatherings, acting different liking anime profile pictures and whatnot, but I'm glad I'm able to be myself without the stress, anxiety and whatnot from family members as I keep it hidden and portray myself still as a male, in front of them and around them, so sometimes it's best if I end up not listening to acknowledging them but who knows, maybe one day I'll find the time to be more free, but again this is only an introductory post to who I am and why I am here, I hope you find of understand it, sorry if it's bad but for now it's the best I can do. I hope you're okay and have a good day, much love to everyone and you all! Love you stay true to yourself, I hope you all have a wonderful day, and I'll speak to you all very soon!  

Much love,  
Lhaeni.
